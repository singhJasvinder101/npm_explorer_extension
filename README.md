# NPM Explorer

NPM Explorer is a Chrome extension designed to simplify the process of searching for NPM packages by providing essential information such as weekly downloads, description, and links to demos and GitHub repositories.

## Features

- **Search NPM Packages**: Quickly search for NPM packages directly within the extension.
- **View Essential Information**: Get detailed information about each package, including its weekly downloads, description, version, and links to demos and GitHub repositories.
- **Save Time**: Save time by eliminating the need to manually search for packages on Google and navigate multiple websites to gather information.

## How It Works

NPM Explorer fetches data from the NPM registry API and presents it in an easy-to-navigate interface within the Chrome extension popup. Simply enter the name of the package you're interested in, and the extension will provide you with a list of relevant packages along with their essential information.

2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in your Chrome browser.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files.
5. The extension should now be installed and visible in your Chrome browser toolbar.

## Usage

1. Click on the extension icon in your Chrome browser toolbar to open the popup.
2. Enter the name of the NPM package you want to search for in the input field.

3. Click on the "Search" button to view the search results.
